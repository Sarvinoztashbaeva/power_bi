       1. What is Power BI, and what are its three main components?
 Power BI is a tool from Microsoft that helps create interactive reports and dashboards using data.
   The three main components are:
Power BI Desktop – for creating reports on a computer
Power BI Service – the online platform to share and view reports
Power BI Mobile – the app to see dashboards on phones or tablets

      2. Name two business use cases for Power BI dashboards.
  Sales Tracking – to see daily or monthly sales performance
  Customer Support – to monitor how fast support tickets are solved

      3. How do you download and install Power BI Desktop?
  You can download it from the Microsoft Store or from the official Power BI website. After downloading, just open the file and follow the install steps.

      4. What is the difference between Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service?
  Power BI Desktop is where you build the report. While Power BI Service is where you publish and share it online

      5. What file extension does a Power BI project use?
  It uses the .pbix file extension.

      6. Explain the role of Power Query in Power BI.
  Power Query is like a tool inside Power BI that helps you clean and prepare data before using it in reports.

      7. Why would a business prefer Power BI over Excel for reporting?
  Power BI is better for interactive visuals, handles big data more smoothly, and refreshes data automatically, unlike Excel where you do a lot manually.

      8. Describe one limitation of the free version of Power BI.
  You can’t share reports with others using Power BI Service unless you have a Pro license.

      9. What is a "published report" in Power BI Service?
  It’s a report you upload from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI online platform so that others in your team or company can view and use it.

      10. How does Power BI Mobile enhance accessibility?
  It lets you see your reports on your phone from anywhere, even when you’re not at your desk.

      11. Compare Power BI with Tableau—pros and cons.

  It can connect with Azure stuff like Azure SQL Database and Azure Data Lake to pull data automatically.

      13. What are "gateways" in Power BI, and when are they needed?
Gateways are like bridges that connect your local data (on-premises) to the Power BI Service. You need them when your data is not in the cloud but on your company’s server.

      14. How would you convince a company to adopt Power BI? (ROI argument)
I’d say Power BI helps save time and gives better insights. You don’t need to spend hours making Excel reports – it refreshes data automatically and helps make faster decisions, which means saving money in the long run.

      15. What security features does Power BI offer for sensitive data?
There’s row-level security (only lets people see data they’re allowed to), encryption, and Microsoft security features since Power BI is part of the Microsoft ecosystem.
