    1. What is a primary key in a table?
It’s a column that has unique values for each row. It helps to identify each row in a table.

    2. Name the two types of table relationships in Power BI.
One-to-many, many-to-many

    3. How do you create a relationship between two tables in Power BI?
Go to the Model view, drag a column from one table to a matching column in another table.

    4. What is a "star schema"?
It’s a way to organize tables where one main table (like sales) is in the middle and is connected to other smaller tables (like products, customers). The shape looks like a star.

    5. Which table is typically the fact table in a sales dataset?
The Sales table because it has numbers like quantity, price, and transactions.

    6. Explain why a star schema improves performance.
Because it’s simple and clear. Power BI can read and filter data faster when the relationships are one-to-many and not too complex.

    7. Use bidirectional filtering sparingly—when is it appropriate?
Only when both tables need to filter each other. Like in reporting where filters need to go both ways. But usually one direction is better.
