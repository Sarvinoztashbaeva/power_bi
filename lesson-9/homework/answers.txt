     1. What is row context? Give an example in a calculated column.
  Row context exists in calculated columns and iterates row by row in a table. It allows access to other columns in the same row. 
For example: TotalPrice = Sales[Quantity] * Sales[UnitPrice]

     2. Use RELATED to fetch the Name from the Customers table into the Sales table.
  CustomerName = RELATED(Customers[Name])

     3. What does CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Quantity]), Sales[Category] = "Electronics") return?
  This returns the total quantity sold for products in the "Electronics" category.

     4. Explain the difference between VAR and RETURN in DAX.
  VAR defines variables to store expressions, tables, or values.
RETURN is used to output the result of the calculation using those variables.

     5. Fix this error: A calculated column in Sales uses RELATED(Customers[Region]) but returns blanks.
  First check if the relationship exists and is active. If it is, then ensure every CustomerID in Sales has a match in Customers.

     6. Why does CALCULATE override existing filters?
  Because CALCULATE modifies the filter context. It can replace, add, or remove filters passed into it.

     7. Troubleshoot: A CALCULATE measure ignores a slicer. Whatâ€™s the likely cause?
  You probably used ALL() or REMOVEFILTERS() in the measure, which disables slicers.
