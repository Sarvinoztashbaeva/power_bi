    1. What does DAX stand for?
  DAX = Data Analysis Expressions

    2. What is the difference between a calculated column and a measure?
  Calculated Column:
      Row by row (adds new column)	
      Stored in memory
      Filter, slicer, group-by
  Measure:
      Aggregated over entire context
      Not stored in memory
      KPI, visuals, aggregations

    3. What does COUNTROWS() do in DAX?
  It counts the number of rows in a table.

    4. What is a circular dependency error in a calculated column?
  It happens when a calculated column depends on itself directly or indirectly. Example: Column A refers to Column B, and B refers back to A.

    5. Explain row context vs. filter context.
  Row context	evaluates each row separately (in columns). Filter context applies filters from visuals or slicers
